        In this website, you will find information about these three singing
        voice synthesizer software, as well as samples of songs made with each
        software and little fun facts about each software and characters
        mentioned. There are many more singing voice synthesizer software out
        there, but these three are one of the softwares that I personally use in
        many of my videos.
