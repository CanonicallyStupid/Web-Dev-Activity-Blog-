        MikuMikuDance (MMD) is a free 3D animation software originally developed
        for creating dance animations featuring the virtual idol Hatsune Miku.
        It is a game, without the game. It allows users to create and animate 3D
        models, primarily of anime-style characters, by manipulating their
        movements and poses. MMD has gained a large following among fans of
        Vocaloid and 3D animation, leading to a vibrant community that shares
        models, motion data, and tutorials.
